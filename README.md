<h1> X-Ray Pneumonia Classification Project </h1>

# Overview

This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia , using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from X-ray images with high accuracy.

The project explores three different approaches to address the data imbalance issue between the normal and pneumonia classes:

1. **SMOTE-based Approach** : Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset before training the CNN model.
2. **Imbalanced Dataset Approach** : Trained the CNN model directly on the imbalanced dataset without addressing the imbalance.
3. **Balanced Dataset Approach** : Balanced the dataset by taking an equal number of images from both classes.

Additionally, created a Streamlit web application to allow users to upload X-ray images and receive classification in real-time. Uploaded images are stored in a dedicated folder for further/future analysis.

# Streamlit Web Interface
* Streamlit application allows users to upload X-ray images and view classification results in real-time.
* Uploaded images are stored in a dedicated folder `(uploads)` for record-keeping


# Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Imbalance**:
    - Issue: The dataset had significantly more pneumonia images than normal images
    - Solution: Explored three approachesâ€”SMOTE, imbalanced dataset training, and Balanced Dataset Approach to address the imbalance.
- **Overfitting**:
    - Issue: The model tended to overfit on the training data.
    - Solution: Applied techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation to improve generalization.  
- **Real-Time Predictions**:
    - Issue: Needed a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
    - Solution: Developed a Streamlit web application to provide a seamless user experience.
